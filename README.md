# Car Maintenance App #
##Synopsis##
An object oriented Android application (programmed via .java and formatted via .xml) that uses Facebook and Gmail APIs in unison 
with a Firebase database to keep track of users and user data in order to assist with car maintenance.
##Motivation##
A car is the typical person's primary form of transportation, used daily and often multiple times a day. However, cars are very
difficult to maintain, as there are various maintenance issues that need to be taken care of periodically. People will often
forget to get all of their maintenance issues done on time (for example, have you always remembered to get your oil change 
done at the correct mileage?). In order to combat this, the Car Maintenance App will keep track of all user inputted cars and 
each car's history of expenses, and upcoming maintenance issues - using the user's current location to find all nearby 
shops/companies that offer a fix to the issue. The user's mileage is kept track of in order to determine how close the user is to
a certain upcoming issue so that he/she can take care of it accordingly.

**Facebook** - Used for login 
<br />
**Gmail** - used for login

##Tests##
Download the application and make your own account. This will give you full functionality (as of the date of the download) of the
application as a user.

Make sure to create your own developer ID with facebook and firebase. Otherwise your data will be saved onto the firebase stored
in the file currently. When creating your own firebase, go to Authentification and turn on google and facebook sign in. Once you 
have done this you will need to replace our googe.json file with the one created specifically for your firebase account.
